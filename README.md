# level-editor

## Project setup

In order to install the necessary packages, without creating any large diffs, run the following command in the level-editor.

```
npm ci
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

In order to see the site and create your own levels, run the following command in the level-editor folder after setup.

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production if needed

```
npm run build
```

### That is all you need to use the editor!

Other instructions should be on the level-editor itself.
